I am a postdoctoral researcher focussed on the elucidation of the relationship between optical and chemical properties of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM). I use analytical techniques such as:

- Fluorescence emission-excitation matrix (EEM) spectroscopy
- Absorbance spectroscopy
- High Performance Size Exclusion Chromatography (HPSEC)
- Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS)

In conjunction with these analytical techniques, I focus on the data analysis using multivariate statistical models (chemometrics) such as:

- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC & PARAFAC2)
- N-way partial least squares (N-PLS)
- Advanced Coupled Matrix and Tensor Factorization (ACMTF)

I am very passionate about Open Science. In the past, I've developed an Open Source Software toolbox and hosted open Webinars to disseminate our research.
