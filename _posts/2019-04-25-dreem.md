Together with Kate Murphy, I've been working on an exciting update to the drEEM toolbox. 

The functions are now supporting parallel computing, which means that all the CPU's in your computer are utilized in PARAFAC. This speeds the fitting up by quite a bit.

I've also worked on a number of functions that allow for much improved plotting of data.
