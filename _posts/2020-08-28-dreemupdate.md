I'm happy to tell you that I've released a new update to the drEEM toolbox for Matlab. in v0.6.0, we worked on a brand-new documentation, improved a lot of functionality, and even added some new features.

The drEEM toolbox (decomposition routines for Excitation Emission Matrices) has been developed to support and extend the application of PARAFAC to fluorescence Excitation Emission Matrix (EEM) datasets.
