I've completed my 2.5yr postdoc at Chalmers University and am happy to tell you that today, I am starting a new position at the Technical University of Denmark's National Institute of Aquatic Resources.
My research will focus on understanding the flux and fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Arctic Ocean. 
I will use the color of DOM as a proxy to distinguish biologically produced material from terrestrial material that originates from rivers. 
Because it is widely assumed that marine and terrestrial DOM differ in their chemical stability, this partitioning is needed to assess the impact of climate change on the cycling of carbon in the Arctic Ocean.
